[View Live](https://www.ivanmattie.com/games/tic-tac-toe/)

Simple vanilla JS/CSS Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation. Utilizes CSS grid to 
lay out the game board.

Built as a Codevember project.

## Overview

Most of the actual game-y logic is found in `src/TicTacToeGame.js`, all of the 
other JS source files handle UI state and adding/removing CSS classes as
nessesary for animations and indicating game state.
